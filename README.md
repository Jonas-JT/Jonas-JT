## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Jonas T. â€” also known as *Dragon*

I'm a fullstack developer with a special focus on the back-end. I enjoy building solutions that make sense, solve real problems, and are backed by solid code.

Lately, I've been exploring the world of programming with Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS â€” always looking for ways to grow, learn new things, and take on technical challenges that push me out of my comfort zone.

> I'm always exploring new tools and best practices to expand my stack.

### ðŸŒ± Always learning

Every project is a new opportunity to grow â€” whether it's a new technology, a different way of thinking, or a better approach to solving problems.  
My goal is to grow as a developer and, more importantly, as someone who truly enjoys creating with code.
